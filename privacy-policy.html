        <h1>Privacy Policy for Sobix</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: 23 November 2025</p>
        <p class="meta">Owner: “Sobix” by an independent developer (Ilya)</p>
        <p class="tagline">
            This Privacy Policy describes how Sobix (“<strong>App</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) collects,
            uses, stores, and protects your information when you use the Sobix mobile application and any related services.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>1. General Information</h2>
        <p>
            By downloading, accessing, or using Sobix, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of it,
            please do not use the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sobix is a sobriety and self-improvement tracker with gamified features such as milestones, quizzes, fragments
            (in-app virtual currency), avatars, and premium content. The App is intended for users aged <strong>13 and older</strong>
            and is <strong>not</strong> directed to children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only the data necessary to operate the App, provide premium features, and improve stability.</p>

        <h3>2.1. Account & Identification Data</h3>
        <p>
            To use certain features (sync, premium, cross-device access), you may sign in, for example with
            <strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> via Firebase Authentication. In this case, Firebase processes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase user ID (<strong>UID</strong>);</li>
            <li>Authentication identifiers (e.g., Apple ID–linked anonymized identifier);</li>
            <li>Optionally, your email address if you choose to share it with us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> receive your Apple password. We do not require your real name or phone number to use the core
            functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2. App Content & Profile Data (Firebase Firestore)</h3>
        <p>
            Sobix is built around your personal progress and in-app state. Through Firebase Firestore we may store data such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your sobriety start date, streak, and progress data;</li>
            <li>Completed milestones, unlocked rewards, and achievement status;</li>
            <li>Quiz results (scores, completion state);</li>
            <li>Your fragments balance and fragments transaction history;</li>
            <li>Which avatars you use or have unlocked (including premium or ultra-premium avatars);</li>
            <li>Basic app preferences (language, selected themes, notification settings, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is linked to your account identifier (UID) to keep your experience consistent across sessions and devices.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions (Apple & RevenueCat)</h3>
        <p>
            Sobix uses <strong>Apple In-App Purchases</strong> and <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage subscriptions and one-time
            purchases. When you purchase or restore:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions such as <strong>Sobix Plus</strong> (e.g. Weekly, Annual, Lifetime);</li>
            <li>Fragments packs (e.g. 300 / 700 / 1500 / 4000 / 10000 fragments);</li>
            <li>One-time products like <strong>Ultra-Premium Avatars</strong>,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>we may process and receive from Apple/RevenueCat information including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymous app-specific user or device identifier;</li>
            <li>Type of product or subscription purchased;</li>
            <li>Purchase date, renewal status, expiry date, and country/region of the Store;</li>
            <li>Receipt and transaction identifiers necessary for validation and fraud prevention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> process or store your full payment card details. All payments are handled by Apple and their
            payment providers.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4. Device & Usage Data</h3>
        <p>
            To maintain and improve the App, we may collect device and usage information, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device model, OS version, app version;</li>
            <li>Language, region, and basic time zone information;</li>
            <li>In-app events (e.g. which screen was opened, whether a feature was used);</li>
            <li>Anonymous crash reports and performance metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data may be collected through Firebase services (such as Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics) or similar tools.
        </p>

        <h3>2.5. Data You Contact Us With</h3>
        <p>
            If you contact us for support (for example, via email or via a link in the App or on the App Store page), we may
            process:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your email address and any name you provide;</li>
            <li>The contents of your message and any additional information you choose to send (screenshots, logs, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Enable and manage in-app purchases, subscriptions, and entitlements via Apple and RevenueCat;</li>
            <li>Sync your data across sessions/devices using Firebase;</li>
            <li>Send optional push notifications and reminders (if you allow them in iOS settings);</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We do not build a marketing profile outside of Sobix or share your
            personal data with third parties for their own direct marketing.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Legal Bases (for users in the EEA/UK and similar regions)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or a similar jurisdiction, we process your data based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to provide you with the App and its features;</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to secure the App, prevent abuse, and improve the service;</li>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for optional features like analytics or push notifications, where required;</li>
            <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> – to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. How We Share Your Data</h2>
        <p>We share your data only with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service providers</strong> that help us operate Sobix, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Firebase (Google LLC and its affiliates) – authentication, database, analytics, crash reporting, and hosting;</li>

                    <li>Analytics and crash-reporting tools used strictly to improve the App.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Apple</strong> – as part of in-app purchases, subscriptions, and App Store distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Authorities</strong> – only when required by applicable law or in response to valid legal processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These third parties process data on our behalf and in accordance with their own privacy policies and applicable data
            protection laws.
        </p>

        <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            Our service providers (such as Firebase and RevenueCat) may store and process data on servers located in various
            countries (for example, the European Union, the United States, or other regions).
        </p>
        <p>
            Where required by law, we take appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of
            protection in line with applicable data protection regulations.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We keep your data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As long as you maintain an account or actively use Sobix;</li>
            <li>For as long as needed to provide you with purchased content or subscriptions;</li>
            <li>For the period required by applicable law (for example, for accounting or legal obligations);</li>
            <li>For a limited period after account deletion or inactivity, to complete internal processes and backups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may retain aggregated or anonymized data that does not identify you personally for analytics, statistics, or
            product improvement.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal data we hold about you;</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data;</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your account and associated personal data (subject to legal obligations);</li>
            <li>Object to or restrict certain processing activities;</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent;</li>
            <li>Portability of certain data, where applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can exercise many of these rights directly in the App (for example, by managing your profile or settings). If
            you need help or want to submit a request, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.
        </p>

        <h3>8.1. Push Notifications</h3>
        <p>
            You can enable or disable push notifications in your <strong>iOS device settings</strong> at any time. If you disable
            notifications, Sobix may not be able to remind you about check-ins or milestones.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2. Subscriptions & Purchases</h3>
        <p>
            All recurring subscriptions (such as Sobix Plus Weekly or Annual) can be managed and cancelled through your
            <strong>Apple ID account settings</strong>. You can cancel at any time; after cancellation, your subscription will remain
            active until the end of the current billing period.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Sobix is designed for users aged <strong>13 and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children
            under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use Sobix or send us any personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we
            will take steps to delete that information as soon as reasonably possible.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit (HTTPS)
            and security best practices for our database and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we work
            continuously to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>
            The App or its website (for example, a GitHub or landing page) may contain links to third-party websites or services
            that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those websites. We
            encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of
            this page. In case of significant changes, we may also provide an in-app notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your continued use of Sobix after any changes means that you accept the updated Privacy Policy. If you do not agree,
            you should stop using the App.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>
            If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, your data, or your rights, you can contact us via the support: ilushazs@icloud.com
