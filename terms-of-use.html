        <h1>Terms of Use for Sobix</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last updated: 23 November 2025</p>
        <p class="meta">Owner: “Sobix” by an independent developer (Ilya)</p>
        <p class="tagline">
            These Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of the Sobix mobile application
            and any related services (“<strong>App</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”).
            By downloading, installing, or using Sobix, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <hr class="section-divider">

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing or using Sobix in any way (including browsing, creating an account, or making in-app purchases),
            you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and the App owner. In addition, your use of Sobix is
            also subject to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>; and</li>
            <li>Apple’s terms and conditions and policies applicable to your use of the App Store and in-app purchases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Eligibility & Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Sobix is intended for users aged <strong>13 years and older</strong>. The App is <strong>not</strong> directed to children
            under 13. If you are under 13, you are not allowed to use Sobix.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction (for example, under 18), you may only use Sobix with the
            permission and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms on your behalf. By using the App,
            you confirm that you meet these requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Health & Wellbeing Disclaimer (No Medical Advice)</h2>
        <p>
            Sobix is a <strong>sobriety and self-improvement tracker</strong> with gamified elements (milestones, quizzes,
            fragments, avatars, and rewards). It is designed for motivation and self-reflection only.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sobix <strong>does not provide medical, psychological, psychiatric, addiction treatment, or any other professional
            healthcare advice</strong>. The App is not a substitute for diagnosis, treatment, or advice from qualified healthcare
            professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Always seek the advice of a doctor, therapist, or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have
            about alcohol use, addiction, or mental health. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it
            because of something you have seen in Sobix.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Account & Authentication</h2>
        <p>
            To use certain features (such as synchronization, premium content, or cross-device access), you may need to create or
            use an account via Firebase Authentication (e.g., “Sign in with Apple”). You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and device security;</li>
            <li>All activities that occur under your account;</li>
            <li>Promptly notifying us if you believe your account has been compromised.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We reserve the right, at our reasonable discretion, to suspend or terminate your access to the App if we suspect
            any misuse, violation of these Terms, or fraudulent activity.
        </p>

        <h2>5. License to Use the App</h2>
        <p>
            Subject to your compliance with these Terms and any applicable App Store rules, we grant you a limited,
            non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

        <p>
            The App and all associated content and materials (including user interface, graphics, animations, avatars, rewards,

        <h2>7. Virtual Currency & Virtual Items (Fragments, Avatars, Rewards)</h2>
        <p>
            Sobix includes a system of virtual content and rewards, which may include:

        </ul>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise clearly stated, all such elements are <strong>virtual items</strong> and:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have <strong>no real-world monetary value</strong>;</li>
            <li>Cannot be exchanged for real money, real goods, or services outside the App;</li>
            <li>Are non-transferable between users, accounts, or apps, except where the App explicitly allows it;</li>
            <li>Are licensed to you, not sold, and remain the property of the App owner at all times.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.1. Purchase of Fragments (Fragments Store)</h3>

            obligated to do so.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2. Ultra-Premium Avatars</h3>
        <p>

            We reserve the right to modify, adjust, or discontinue virtual items, fragments pricing, availability, and in-app

        </p>

        <h2>8. Subscriptions & In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>
            Sobix uses Apple’s in-app purchase system and RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and purchases. By making a purchase
            in the App, you agree that:

        </ul>

        <h3>8.1. Sobix Plus Subscription</h3>

            <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase;</li>

            <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period;</li>
            <li>You can manage and cancel your subscription at any time in your <strong>Apple ID account settings</strong> on your device;</li>
            <li>If you cancel, you will retain access to Sobix Plus features until the end of the current billing period; no partial refunds are offered for unused time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            effect at the end of the current paid period.
        </p>

        <h3>8.3. Free Trials</h3>
        <p>
            If Sobix offers a free trial in your region, the specific terms (duration, included features, conversion to paid
            subscription) will be clearly shown in the App Store and/or within the App. If you do not cancel the subscription at
            least 24 hours before the end of the trial, your Apple ID account may be charged for the next period at the standard
            price.
        </p>

        <h3>8.4. Refunds</h3>
        <p>
            Refunds for in-app purchases and subscriptions are generally handled by Apple according to its policies. To request a
            refund, you may need to use Apple’s “Report a Problem” page or your App Store account, in line with Apple’s rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not guarantee any refunds for subscriptions, fragments, or virtual items and do not process refunds directly,
            except where required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>9. User Conduct & Prohibited Uses</h2>

        </ul>

        <h2>10. Termination & Suspension</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Sobix at any time, with or without notice, if we
            reasonably believe that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have violated these Terms or applicable law;</li>
            <li>Your actions risk harm to the App, other users, or third parties;</li>
            <li>We are required to do so by law or by a competent authority.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Upon termination, your license to use Sobix will end, and you may lose access to your account data, subscriptions,
            fragments, and virtual items, as permitted by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
            Sobix is provided on an “<strong>as is</strong>” and “<strong>as available</strong>” basis, without warranties of any kind,
            whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not warrant that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free;</li>
            <li>Any data or content obtained through the App will be accurate, complete, or reliable;</li>
            <li>Issues will be corrected immediately.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Your use of Sobix and any actions you take based on its content are at your own risk. You remain responsible for your
            own decisions regarding alcohol use, health, and lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we and our partners, licensors, and service providers will not be
            liable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages;</li>
            <li>Loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses;</li>
            <li>Any damage resulting from your access to or use of (or inability to use) the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In any case, our total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or related to the App will not exceed
            the greater of: (a) the amounts you have paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or (b) the minimum amount
            required by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not
            apply to you.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
            To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the App owner and its partners, licensors,
            and service providers from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including
            reasonable legal fees) arising out of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your use or misuse of Sobix;</li>
            <li>Your violation of these Terms;</li>
            <li>Your violation of any law or third-party rights.</li>

        <p>
            We may update, modify, or discontinue any part of Sobix at any time, with or without notice, including features,
            virtual items, prices, or content.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of
            this page and may provide an in-app notice for significant changes. Your continued use of Sobix after the changes
            become effective means you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you should stop using the
            App.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>

            its conflict of law provisions), unless the laws of your country of residence require otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of Sobix will be subject to the jurisdiction of the
